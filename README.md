# Extension Grant – Bridge

## Dear Qubic Foundation Team,

We are pleased to present this request for a grant, emphasizing the significant additional work and contributions made by Vottun during the development of the Bridge project. These efforts, while beyond the initial project scope, have established a robust technical foundation and paved the way for future innovations within the Qubic ecosystem.

## Challenges and Proactive Solutions

During the project, we encountered opportunities to address and enhance areas that required further refinement:

### 1. Optimizing Support for Implementing Smart Contract Events:
- While Redis PubSub functionalities were evolving, our team explored alternative methods, eventually designing and implementing a polling approach based on the feedback received from the Qubic core team. This solution required significant development effort but provided a scalable and reliable framework for future use.

### 2. Improving the Testing Environment:
- We found that the Qubic testing setup offered room for enhancement, particularly around clarity and accessibility. As we couldn´t test as we expected, we invested time in developing a dedicated local RPC solution and creating configuration guides, which now provide a solid foundation for future development and testing. This effort and knowledge can be shared so other developers will be able to set up their testing more easily and efficiently.   

### 3. Evolving Testnet Performance and Functionalities:
- As the testnet was in its early stages, we took the initiative to address and adapt to evolving features and stability. Our efforts ensured progress even in a dynamic environment, and our implemented solutions have established a replicable framework for other projects. Once again, this effort and knowledge can be shared so other developers will be able to set up their testing more easily and efficiently.

## Contributions Beyond the Scope

To ensure the success of the project and enhance the Qubic ecosystem, Vottun undertook significant additional work:

### 1. Creation of Comprehensive Documentation:
- We developed detailed guides for Smart Contract setup and testing, including virtual machine deployment, RPC configuration, and cross-platform compatibility solutions. These resources provide long-term value to the ecosystem.

### 2. Establishment of a Stable Testing Environment:
- Deploying a dedicated RPC created a reliable framework for testing and future development, directly addressing the needs of developers.

### 3. Polling System Implementation:
- Designing and validating a polling-based event-listening system allowed for efficient Smart Contract interaction and provided a versatile solution for the ecosystem.

### 4. Framework for Long-Term Development:
- The technical solutions we contributed have strengthened the Qubic ecosystem providing a replicable model for future projects on the platform.
